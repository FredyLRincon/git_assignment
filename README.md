e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a text-based tool for developers to track and manage changes in their code. It is local, or in other words, all changes are saved on their computers.
GitHub is a GUI- a web-based service for Git repositories that allows developers to collaborate.

f. What does git diff do?
git diff is a command that highlights the differences between two versions of a file.

g. What is the main branch?
It is the default branch for a git repository. The master copy. Once the changes made in the branches are OK, then they can be incorporated in the main branch / master copy.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
As per question g, it's not a best practice to publish directly into the master copy (main), especially when working in teams. Instead, it is better to have your drafts in a branch. Once they reach a final or ideal state, then they can be published in the main branch via pull request.
